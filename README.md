## 📝 Project Overview

### Objective
1. **Dropout Rate Analysis:** The company wants to identify which student backgrounds have the highest drop-out rates to identify needed improvements.

2. **Student Progress Analysis:** The company seeks to analyze student progress through various stages of the course to understand the time spent and pinpoint areas needing improvement for a better course
completion rates.

### Dataset
The data captures:
- **Enrollment Date:** Students’ initial interaction starting on **8th November 2023**.
- **Last Interaction Date:** Data recorded up to **15th November 2023**.
- **Student Attributes:** Including educational background (BTech, BCom) and progress at each stage.
- **Course Stages:** Enrolled → Level 1 → Level 2 → Course Completed.

## 📈 Key Insights

- **Completion Rate:** 
  - Overall: **23.33%**
  - BTech: **25.00%**
  - BCom: **20.00%**
- **Dropout Rates:** 
  - From Enrolled to Level 1: **46.67%**
  - From Level 1 to Level 2: **37.50%**
  - From Level 2 to Course Completion: **30.00%**
- **Time to Completion:**
